# FAQ

## What is that?

A user friendly tool that allows you to spawn AI assistants in a blink of an eye.

## Is it for free?

Our tool is. However, the AI model underneath is provided by OpenAI and costs some money. The cost is minor unless you use it extensively.
Learn more about OpenAI's pricing policy [here](https://openai.com/pricing). We use the model called gpt-3.5-turbo.

## How to use it?

1. Get an OpenAI API Key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You will need an account if you don't have one already.

2. Go to [GPTer web page](https://gpter-ai.vercel.app/)

3. Insert your API key and validate it.

4. Create your first assistant and start chatting.

## Will you have my API Key?

No. The key gets stored in your browser and is used to communicate with OpenAI (i.e. GPT) directly. It never reaches our premises. In fact, we don't even have 'premises' so far. The App is purely Front End.

## Any new features in the future?

- Desktop app installers for you to comfortably work with GPTer without the need to open your browser.

# Development

## Launch GPTer locally

Why, that's easy considering there's no Backend at the moment.

Run the following command in the **./app** folder:

`npm run dev`

This will do at least two things:

- Start the Electron app locally
- Start the local server - normally at port **5137** , so you can open the respective URL in your browser.

For other scripts check out **./package.json**

# Contributions

We want this tool to be alive and evolving. We want more ideas from the community and we are happy about potential contributions. Here a couple of tips for you if you want to bring in your programming effort:

- Check out our issues. Especially the ones labelled as 'help wanted' and 'good first issue'

- Do not take issues labeled with 'work in progress'! Unless you want to provide an alternative implementation and do not mind that your work might go in vain.

- If you are about to work on an issue - make us aware of it in a comment on the issue. We will set the issue as 'work in progress' to mark it as taken.

- Try to be reasonably fast. If we see an issue is taken but no progress was made for a while - we might remove the WIP label and/or do it ourselves.

- Submitting an issue, design suggestion or an advice is also a contribution!
